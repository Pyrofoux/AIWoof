# What is AIWolf?

Quoting from [aiwolf.org](http://aiwolf.org/en/introduction):

> a project to create an “Artificial Intelligence Werewolf” (AIWolf) to play as
> the werewolf in place of a human player. The objective of this comprehensive
> project is not only to develop a game-playing algorithm, but also to develop
> virtual agents, real robots, and so on.

The AI Competition currently has 2 branches, one protocol-based where agents can
use a predefined grammar to communicate, and one NLP-based. This repository has
information on the protocol-based branch of the competition.

To learn the rules and how to play the Werewolf game, please refer to [this

See the [docs/](docs/) directory for the original documentation of AIWolf,
[manual/](manual/) for information about how to setup your own agents and
run them, and [src/](src/) for sample agents.

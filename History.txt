Plays randomly, except for voting.
Heat Vote = (roles['WEREWOLF']+roles['POSSESSED'])*(profile['hostility']*profile['complexity']+1)
Seer only
Silent
Score = 0.430 - 0.540
100 games x2
5 agents with 4 SampleAgent from the game server

+Heat for Divine
same as Vote
Score = 0.510 - 0.550- 0.650 , on 100 games x 3

+Minimal Heat when trivial cases like
  - not divining someone with known team
  - not using powers on dead agents
  - not voting for itself (however it may be useful in the future)

Role Priority =
if we're HUMAN (not POSSESSED)
rolePriority = roles['WEREWOLF'] * 2 + roles['POSSESSED']

if we're WEREWOLF or POSSESSED
rolePriority = roles['SEER']*3 + roles['MEDIUM']*2 + roles['VILLAGER']

heat = rolePriority*(hostility*complexity+1)

Score = 0.440 - 0,560 - 0,570 -  0.610 on 100 games x 4 with any role (SEER, POSSESSED, VILLAGER x2, WEREWOLF)
Completely silent agent


TODO next :
- Declaring attacks
- Detecting lies
- More accurate probabilities (first calculating number of known humans, then doing conditional probabilities)
- Not only guarding self

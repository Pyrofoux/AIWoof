v.0 02/07/19

Plays randomly, except for voting.
Heat Vote = (roles['WEREWOLF']+roles['POSSESSED'])*(profile['hostility']*profile['complexity']+1)
Seer only
Silent
Score = 0.430 - 0.540
100 games x2
5 agents with 4 SampleAgent from the game server

+Heat for Divine
same as Vote
Score = 0.510 - 0.550- 0.650 , on 100 games x 3

+Minimal Heat when trivial cases like
  - not divining someone with known team
  - not using powers on dead agents
  - not voting for itself (however it may be useful in the future)

Role Priority =
if we're HUMAN (not POSSESSED)
rolePriority = roles['WEREWOLF'] * 2 + roles['POSSESSED']

if we're WEREWOLF or POSSESSED
rolePriority = roles['SEER']*3 + roles['MEDIUM']*2 + roles['VILLAGER']

heat = rolePriority*(hostility*complexity+1)

Score = 0.440 - 0,560 - 0,570 -  0.610 on 100 games x 4 with any role (SEER, POSSESSED, VILLAGER x2, WEREWOLF)
Completely silent agent


TODO next :
- Declaring attacks
- Detecting lies
- More accurate probabilities (first calculating number of known humans, then doing conditional probabilities)
- Not only guarding self

v.0 was tested on the game server during the night
For each test set, the agent is playing games with randomized roles with the same 4 agents

The scores against other agents where from most recent to oldest :
0.488 0.483 0.485 0.440 0.535 0.442
It looks like it's the mean for all tests since the beginning, not just the current test run

v.0.1 :
* counting the agents dead during the night as HUMANs . (WEREWOLVEs can eat themselves, but it will not be in the meta game before long)
* setting a +1 to hostility and complexity, (for now 100 in hostility and 0 in complexity gives 0)
* WEREWOLF  :
            *  giving high trust in someone declaring we're HUMAN (POSSESSED)
            *   set role to WEREWOLF when other agents are whispering

added TODO :
- POSSESSED :
    - coming out as SEER and declaring everyone to be HUMAN to both alert the WEREWOLF and gain trust

v.0.2 :
* Fix : * WEREWOLF whispering correct attacks
        * removed getting role info from whispers

* Gets all roles from roleMap

06/07/19

v.0.3

* Role estimations are now made according to every certain information
  about teams and remaining roles , using Bayesian probabilities

added TODO :
- WEREWOLF :- When multiple targets have the same heat, KQ keeps
              saying a different target when whispering.
              Should choose a unique target and declare attack once

            - Increase hostility (or other metric) when other wolves
            suggest that someone is SEER, MEDIUM, and decrease when POSSESSED

            - Detect hostility when someone is hostile towards other wolf

- SEER, MEDIUM :- Sharing informations about known teams when the game
                has progressed enough or when sensible information are found
- VILLAGER     :
